	<h2 id="agrof">Agro-Forestry</h2><br>
	<p>Agroforestry can be defined as a dynamic management system for natural resources based on ecological principles which introduces trees into farms and the agricultural landscape, thereby facilitating a form of diversified and sustained production that improves social, economic and environmental conditions for all land users. It is a land-use system that combines trees, shrubs, or perennial vines with other agricultural crops and/or livestock, that provides two major benefits for farmers: it adds perennial components to the farm (adding new long-term income sources) and creates a more diverse system of plants on the farm that better mimics a natural ecosystem.</p>
	<p>The creation of agroforestry plots exploits the complementary nature of trees, on the one hand, and crops or livestock farming on the other, improving use of environmental resources. These practices significantly reduce run-off and soil erosion, improve soil ecosystems, and provide habitats for various species. They also diversify farm-scale products and revenue sources. Mixed farming, which combines the ecological niches of different species, can increase overall productivity compared to monocultures, as the ecological niches of different species are complementary.<br> 
	This alos has been identifies as an available potential lever to mitigate and adapt to climate-change, increase food security, and combat desertification and soil degradation. Because they increase soil organic matter and carbon sequestration, agroforestry systems have a particular role to play in achieving the worldwide ‘4 per 1000’ target.</p>

	<h2 id="waterM">Water management</h2><br><br>

	<div class="row" id="rowAdjustment">
		<div class="about-col" id="picContent">
			<p>Water is essential for agriculture, and the increasing demand for water resources has brought about the need for sustainable water management practices. To ensure the long-term sustainability of agricultural production, it is important to consider water management as part of an integrated approach to sustainable agriculture.<br>
			This includes a range of practices, including efficient water use, water conservation, and water recycling. <br> Here are several such ways of water management in ecological agriculture;</p>	
		</div>

	</div>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Drip irrigation</li>
		<p>Drip irrigation is the most efficient way to provide crops with the necessary water and nutrients for optimal growth. This method delivers water and nutrients directly to the root zone of each plant, in precise amounts and at the right time. As a result, farmers can achieve higher yields while using less water, fertiliser, and energy. Drip irrigation allows for precise and targeted application of resources, reducing waste and maximising the efficiency of water and nutrient use in agriculture.</p><br>
		<li>Capturing and storing water</li>
		<p>Water harvesting and reuse systems are designed to collect and store runoff and stormwater, which can be used later for various purposes. These systems have local benefits, such as reducing runoff volume and preventing water quality degradation downstream. <br>They also contribute to sustainable water management by utilising collected water for future use, reducing reliance on freshwater sources, and promoting water conservation. These systems provide multiple benefits, including local water availability, reduced runoff, improved water quality, and enhanced overall water resource management.</p><br>
		<li>Irrigation scheduling</li>
		<p>Irrigation system managers use irrigation schedules to determine the appropriate frequency and duration of watering. Water management takes into account the method of irrigation, as well as the amount, timing, and frequency of water application. Farmers regularly monitor weather forecasts, soil moisture, and plant condition to adjust their irrigation schedules accordingly and prevent both under-watering and over-watering of their crops. This proactive approach helps optimise water use, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time for optimal growth while avoiding water waste and potential negative impacts on plant health and productivity.</p><br>
		<li>Planting crops resistant to drought</li>
		<p>Farmers can enhance their crop productivity per unit of water by cultivating crops that are well-suited to the local climate. Drought-resistant crops are particularly advantageous, as they can reduce the risk of crop failure during periods of water scarcity, improve overall yields, and enhance economic stability for farmers. Additionally, these crops can contribute to water conservation efforts, which are vital for sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation. By growing crops adapted to the local climate and requiring less water, farmers can optimise water use, mitigate risks associated with drought, and promote long-term sustainability in agriculture.</p><br>
		<li>Using Compost and Mulch</li>
		<p>Compost, or decomposed organic matter used as fertilizer, has been found to improve soil structure, increasing its water-holding capacity. Mulch is a material spread on top of the soil to conserve moisture. Mulch made from organic materials such as straw or wood chips will break down into compost, further increasing the soil’s ability to retain water. Compost and mulch help Allstar Organics, Tierra Vegetables, and many other Ferry Plaza Farmers Market farms retain more water in the soil during the dry season. Farmers may also use black plastic mulch as a soil cover to suppress weeds and reduce evaporation.</p><br>
		
	</ol>

	<h2 id="pestm">Pest management</h2><br>

	<div class="row" id="rowAdjustment">
		<div class="about-col" id="picContent">
			<p>Pest management encompasses a broad range of topics related to pests of crops such as weeds, diseases (fungal, bacterial and viral), insects, vertebrates (gophers), and slugs and snails. Pests of livestock include filth flies and various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria or viruses, not to mention predators. The information provided here is focused mostly on ecological approaches to pest management. If you can eliminate or reduce the conditions which favor pest populations, these preventive actions can help avoid more expensive measures needed to control pest outbreaks.</p>

			</div>
	</div>

	<p>Pest control strategies must be cost-effective as well as effective, easy to implement, and readily integrated with other crop-production practices. Economic factors involving cost-effectiveness include crop prices, costs and availability of labor, land, equipment, and other production inputs.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Biological-Control Organisms</li>
		<p>Biological-control organisms are living organisms that can be used to manage arthropod (mites and insects), weed, and plant (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes) pests and pathogens. Generally, control organisms do not immediately alleviate disease or prevent or curtail attack; they also do not immediately reduce the pest population. Rather, control is generally achieved over a period of several generations. Biological control organisms commonly interacting with their hosts at low population densities, preventing pests from reproducing to economically important population levels. Control organisms are themselves arthropods, plants, and pathogens and are as diverse as the pests. Some of them are;</p><br>
		<ul id="bioControl">
			<li>Arthropods that prey on or parasitize other arthropods</li>
			<li>Arthropods that prey on or parasitize plants</li>
			<li>Bacterial or fungal antagonists of plant pathogens</li>
			<li>Beneficial nematodes that parasitize arthropods</li>
			<li>Mild strains of plant pathogens</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Biological-Control Products</li>
		<p>Genes or gene products derived from living organisms that kill, disable, or otherwise regulate the behavior of plant pests are biological-control products. Examples include the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, delivered by a killed microbe, and pheromones or other semiochemicals used to kill or disrupt the reproduction of arthropod pests.</p>
		<p>These products are not necessarily more suitable supplements than synthetic products. Synthetic products can be less harmful to environmental balances, while natural plant products like rotenone and pyrethrum can be toxic to beneficial organisms. It is the spectrum and activity of products used in ecologically based pest management that are crucial rather than the source of the products. While, the most useful biological-control products minimally impacting all agroecosystem components except for the target pest.</p>
		<li>Synthetic Chemicals</li>
		<p>Narrow-spectrum synthetic pesticides that meet the criteria of safety, profitability, and durability are suitable supplements for EBPM. For example, the synthetic insecticide pirimicarb is highly selective for one group of pest arthropods, aphids, and does not adversely affect most biological-control organisms.</p><br>
		<li>Resistant Plants</li>
		<p>Plants that have developed resistance against pests will be important components of EBPM. Plant breeders have successfully identified and deployed genes for disease and arthropod resistance in numerous crops; in the future, molecular genetic methods will become more important as a means to producing pest-resistant plants. At present, resistance is the predominant defense against many plant diseases, such as rust diseases, that would otherwise severely limit cereal</p><br>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="soilMan">Soil management</h2>
	<p>Healthy soil is the foundation for long-term success for all farms. Whether organic or conventional, raising livestock or crops, your operation will benefit when you continually improve your soil’s health. Using proper soil management solutions can help you prevent soil erosion, increase soil organic matter and water holding capacity, manage soil fertility, and improve the profitability of your farm.<br><br></p>

	<div class="row" id="rowAdjustment">
		<div class="about-col" id="picContent">
			<p>Unhealthy soil doesn’t absorb much water. Healthy soil acts like a sponge, capable of holding hundreds of thousands of gallons of water in an acre. Regenerative farming practices enable the soil to capture rainfall that otherwise might disappear as runoff. Economically, these practices can increase crop and forage production, drought resilience, access to lucrative new markets, and therefore profitability. Environmentally, they can improve soil health and biodiversity.</p>

	<p>Further, the condition of our soils is being exacerbated by: applying excessive mineral fertilisers on to farm land that has been losing its ability to respond to inputs due to degradation in soil health, and reducing or doing away with crop diversity and rotations due to agrochemical inputs and commodity-based market forces. The situation is leading to further problems of increased threats from insect pests, diseases and weeds against which farmers are forced to apply ever more pesticides and herbicides, and which further damage biodiversity and pollute the environment.</p> <p>Several soil conservation practices that we can follow are;</p><br>
	<ol>
		<li>Cover cropping and mulching</li>
		<p>Cover crops and mulching are effective methods for reducing soil migration and reducing runoff. Mulching, which applies organic materials over exposed soil, provides a covering before decomposition. Hay is the best choice, and it should be harvested before weeds mature. Cover crops like peas can protect against wind erosion and add nitrogen to the soil, as the nitrogen released from their roots is an energy source for microbial metabolic activities. These methods are essential for controlling erosion and promoting an active microbial community in the rhizosphere soil.</p><br>
		<li>Crop rotation</li>
		<p>Crop rotation is a method for managing agro-ecosystem biodiversity by improving soil health, minimizing pests, and reducing disease outbreaks. It involves growing secondary crops to improve soil structure, increase organic matter, and rooting depth. Root crops are particularly destructive to soil structure, so they should be grown once every three years. Corn can be grown with silage and forage, while legume crops like pea and chickpea can modify soil functional microbial communities. Cover cropping or mulching, and zero tillage should be incorporated during crop rotation. This method promotes soil microbial diversity, increasing soil microbial biomass and enhancing C and N cycling.</p><br>
		<li>Conservation tillage</li>
		<p>Conservation tillage is a method aimed at preserving soil aggregates, organic matter, and crop residues. It involves using less destructive tillage implements, minimizing tillage, and leaving crop residue on the soil surface to prevent erosion. Traditional agricultural practices, such as plowing and tilling, have been proven destructive to soil, causing 24% of global agricultural land degradation. A new approach focuses on conserving and improving soil, gradually replacing conventional tillage methods. This method improves soil structure, reduces erosion, improves drainage and water holding capacity, increases soil organic matter, and increases microbial and earthworm activity.</p><br>
		<li>Ridges, terraces and contours</li>
		<p>The ridges are made across wind and they consist of tall listed seed beds that are being formed over the entire field or as trap strips which is in a position perpendicular to the direction of the prevailing wind. The formation of an earthen embankment along a common elevation contour gives an elevated terrace structure that can directly reduce wind erosion by potential reduction in wind speed and interception of soil particles. Indirect wind erosion control benefits of terraces and the related contour tillage and cropping practices expand overall crop grain and residue productivity by controlling runoff for increased water storage in the soil. The underlying layer of soil becomes relatively less disturbed by the action of erosion hence making room for an increased microbial population within the micro-climate.</p><br>
		<li>Residue management</li>
		<p>Residue management is a widely used method for controlling wind erosion in crops and climates. It involves tillage practices that maintain residue from a previous crop as a surface cover to prevent soil erosion. This method improves soil water storage, increases rain infiltration, and reduces evaporation. The micro-climate is well-suited for microbial activities, as residues provide energy for mineralization and disintegration of complex molecules.</p><br>

	<h2 id="climates">Climate solutions</h2><br>

	<div class="row" id="rowAdjustment">
		<div class="about-col" id="picContent">
			<p>Harmful levels of carbon dioxide are building up in the atmosphere and changing our climate. As global average temperatures continue to rise, agricultural producers find themselves on the front lines of this struggle. Extreme weather events and evolving climate cycles require farmers to rapidly adapt to weather the storm. At the same time, agricultural lands have tremendous potential to capture and store heat-trapping carbon dioxide in healthy soils and agroecosystems.</p><br>		
		</div>
			<div class="about-col">
			<img src="http://localhost/st20253489-ecofarming/topics/compost1.jpg" id="imgSize1">
			</div>
	</div>

	<p>Human activity has significantly altered natural environments in all parts of the world and has contributed greatly to the stock of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere: for example, releasing carbon dioxide when felling trees and methane from rice and livestock farming. It has also limited the ability of natural systems to absorb and store, or sequester, carbon from the atmosphere and for natural features such as coral reefs and mangroves to protect communities from the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Compost addition</li>
		<p>Compost is decayed organic matter applied to soil as an organic fertilizer that provides plants with plant-available nutrients. Using compost in place of synthetic fertilizer prevents the release of nitrous oxide, an especially potent greenhouse gas that is often a result of the overapplication of synthetic fertilizer. Compost is a carbon-rich soil amendment that directly adds carbon into the agroecosystem. Additionally, the nutrients from compost are plant-available and microbe-available, helping to rapidly increase the population of soil microbes, which allows for the conversion of organic matter into stable humus in a shorter amount of time</p><br>
		<li>Cover cropping</li>
		<p>Cover cropping is the practice of planting mixes of non-invasive grasses, legumes, and forbs as seasonal vegetative cover on the soil, instead of leaving the soil bare. Cover crops reduce soil erosion, minimize soil compaction, and increase soil porosity—all of which lead to improved microbiome health and rapid creation and maintenance of organic matter.</p><br>
		<li>Reducing tilling</li>
		<p>The conservation tillage techniques of reduced till and no-till/strip-till cultivate soil in a way that minimally disturbs the underground soil microbiome by leaving at least 30% of the soil surface covered in crop or cover crop residue and reducing the number of equipment passes and soil compaction in the fields.<br>
		This practice minimizes soil oxidation and respiration, which releases CO2 from the soil and into the atmosphere. It also maintains soil aggregate stability and can reduce carbon losses through topsoil erosion. Conservation tillage allows for the rapid accrual of soil organic carbon and creation of soil organic matter by leaving the soil microbiome undisturbed and by maintaining conditions critical to microbiome health, such as available plant moisture and root exudates that remain in the soil.</p><br>
		<li>Mulching</li>
		<p>Mulching is the application of woody and carbon-rich plant residues, such as wood chips, to the soil surface to prevent erosion and build soil health. This reduces carbon loss from the soil by reducing erosion and topsoil loss, also helping maintain soil moisture and provides a source of food to sustain a healthy soil microbiome, thus stimulating the rapid production of humus. </p><br>
		
	</ol>

	<h2 id="compost">Composting</h2>
	<p>Composting is an important agricultural practice that has been used to improve soil fertility. It is the process of breaking down organic matter, such as food scraps and yard waste, into a nutrient-rich soil amendment that can be used to improve soil fertility and soil structure. Composting can be done on a small scale in your home garden or on a larger scale through commercial composting operations. Here's a brief overview of both types;</p><br>

		<ol>
		<li>Small-scale composting</li>
		<p>Small-scale composting can be done in your home garden or backyard. This type of composting often involves the use of a compost bin which can be purchased or built from recycled materials. Composting can be done with a variety of organic waste materials such as kitchen scraps, garden waste, lawn clippings, leaves, wood chips, and other biodegradable materials.</p><br>
		<li>Large-scale composting</li>
		<p>Large-scale composting operations are becoming increasingly popular as a way to manage organic waste materials in an environmentally friendly way. These operations can involve a variety of processes, such as aerated static pile composting, windrow composting, and in-vessel composting. The end result of all of these processes is a nutrient-rich soil amendment that can be used to improve soil fertility and soil structure.</p><br>
		
	</ol>

	<h2 id="permacult">Permaculture</h2>
	<p>Permaculture can be understood as the growth of agricultural ecosystems in a self-sufficient and sustainable way.
	This form of agriculture draws inspiration from nature to develop synergetic farming systems based on crop diversity, resilience, natural productivity, and sustainability. Still, since the early 1980s, the pre-conceived idea of permaculture extended to a systemic approach that goes far beyond the agricultural domain.<br>
	Agroecology and permaculture are often confused, yet these two practices are different. Agro-ecology goes further than biological agricultural as it uses sustainable agricultural systems with techniques such as complementarity, composting or cultivation on mounds. Afterward, it integrates these systems in an ecological way by saving water, fighting against erosion etc…<br>
	The practices above can be found in permaculture too, but the latter is broader since it focuses not only on creating sustainable and resilient farming systems but also on integrating them into a broader life system where other variables are also accounted for.</p>

	<p> The livestock sector (including poultry) plays a vital part in food systems and livelihoods of rural households in Sri Lanka, with more than 600,000 registered livestock farms, most of which are small-scale. However, livestock is also one of the country's economic sectors that is most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.<br>
	Sri Lanka's livestock sector mainly comprises cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry. Animal production generated 119 billion rupees in 2018, up from 27 billion in 2010. Dairy and poultry form the vast majority of Sri Lanka's livestock sector, with the dairy industry considered the most important area for investment and development. Sri Lanka has approximately 21 million chickens and 750,000 cattle and buffalo milk cows.<br> Thus, here are several benefits of practicing ecologcal livestck management;</p><br>

	<ul id="bioControl">
		<li>The nutritional quality of pasture-based products like eggs and milk is higher, containing more omega-3s and fatty acids.</li><br>
		<li>The soil improves as it's fertilized with manure.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Since antibiotics are not allowed in organic production, the risk of antibiotic resistance and “superbugs” is eliminated.</li><br>
		<li>Grazing livestock can make use of marginal land not suitable for growing crops.</li><br>
		<li>Livestock provide an additional income stream and help distribute a farmer’s workload through the year.</li><br>
		<li>Animals assist with weed management by eating or trampling unwanted plants.</li><br>
		<li>Farmers have more flexibility when they raise animals. They can choose to sell their crops directly or feed them to the animals as market conditions and other factors shift.</li><br>
	</ul>

			<p>Crop solutions in the context of ecological farming refer to sustainable and environmentally friendly practices and techniques employed to cultivate crops while minimizing the negative impact on the environment and maximizing crop yields. <br>By adopting these practices, Sri Lankan farmers can enhance crop yields, reduce environmental impacts, and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient agricultural sector.<br> These solutions are designed to promote soil health, conserve water, reduce chemical pesticide and fertilizer usage, and increase resilience to pests and diseases. Here are some of our crops that can benefit from ecological farming practices:</p><br>

		<li>Rice: </li><p>Sri Lanka is a major rice-producing country. Ecological farming practices can include integrated pest management (IPM), organic farming methods, and the use of traditional rice varieties that are more resilient to local conditions.</p>
		<li>Tea: </li><p>Sri Lanka is renowned for its tea production. Ecological practices in tea cultivation involve organic methods, reduced pesticide usage, and shade-grown tea bushes to conserve biodiversity.</p>
		<li>Spices: </li><p>Crops like cinnamon, black pepper, and cardamom can benefit from organic and sustainable farming methods, which ensure the purity and quality of these valuable spices.</p>
		<li>Coconut: </li><p>Coconut farming is widespread in Sri Lanka. Ecological practices can include organic coconut farming, intercropping with other crops, and using natural methods for pest control.</p>
		<li>Rubber: </li><p>Sri Lanka is a significant rubber producer. Sustainable rubber farming involves reduced chemical inputs, agroforestry practices, and responsible tapping techniques.</p>
		<li>Fruits: </li><p>Tropical fruits like mangoes, bananas, and papayas can be cultivated using organic and eco-friendly methods, promoting healthy fruit production without harming the environment.</p>
		<li>Vegetables: </li><p>Various vegetables, including okra, eggplant, and leafy greens, can benefit from ecological farming practices such as crop rotation, composting, and biological pest control.</p>
		<li>Agricultural Forests: </li><p>Agroforestry practices, where trees are integrated into farming systems, can be applied to Sri Lankan crops. For example, intercropping coconut with nitrogen-fixing trees can improve soil fertility.</p>
